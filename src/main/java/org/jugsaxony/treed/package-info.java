/**
 * TreeD is a Christmas project of JUG Saxony based on an idea by Matt Parker.
 * (Please visit his Youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths .)
 *
 * A real christmas tree is equipped with a long strain of digital LED bulbs, which means
 * a computer can set the RGB value of every single LED independently. Fun fact: by some
 * basic image processing we also calculated the 3D position of each LED.
 *
 * It is your job (if you choose to accept it) to program an animation for this
 * christmas tree. Since you probably don't have such a christmas tree, we provide
 * a software simulation to be used during development. If you follow all the rules,
 * your implementation will work with both the simulation and the real tree (controlled
 * by a Raspberry Pi).
 *
 * Yes, on the 24th of November 2022 we will present all working implementations of
 * present participants during our christmas session. We will measure a few metrics
 * like FPS or memory load.
 * All presented animations are ranked and the best few even win nice prices.
 * (Please visit http://www.jugsaxony.org/ for details.)
 *
 * To participate please register by sending an email to treed@jugsaxony.org.
 * Once you've implemented your animation send it to treed@jugsaxony.org.
 * (Details will follow.)
 *
 * The real tree will be controlled by an Raspberry PI 4. So please be gentle with
 * the workload. Don't use anything else than Java 8 and your own code.
 * Don't use threads or files or the network. You know, keep things simple.
 *
 * A few words about personal data:
 * You need to include your real name and email address to enable us to identify
 * the brilliant brain behind your amazing animation. As long as you don't win,
 * we won't store it outside of the code and we won't publish your code. But we
 * need the data to process the many animations we hope to receive.
 * During presentation on 24th of November 2022 we will read out and maybe show
 * your name. If you win something we will read out your name again and write it
 * down as documentation for our sponsors.  For more on data safety at JUG Saxony,
